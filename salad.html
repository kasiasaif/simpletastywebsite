    <div class="name"><strong>Greek Salad</strong></div>
    <div>A healthy Greek salad packed with crisp vegetables and creamy feta tossed in a tasty red wine vinaigrette dressing.</div>
    <br>
    <div >Ingredients:</div>
<ul>
        <li >½ cup red onion, ⅛-inch thick slices</li>
        <li>¼ cup red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>8 cups romaine lettuce, ¾-inch thick pieces, about 2 romaine hearts</li>
        <li>1 cup english cucumber, ¼-inch dice</li>
        <li>1 cup tomatoes, ½-inch thick wedges</li>
        <li>¾ cup green bell pepper, ¾-inch dice</li>
        <li>½ cup pitted kalamata olives</li>
        <li>4 ounces feta cheese, ¼-inch cubes</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon honey, optional</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    
        
    <div>Instruction</div>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and 2 tablespoons of honey. 
            Add the sliced red onions and allow them to sit for at least 15 minutes. Drain well before adding to the salad.</li>
        <li>Rinse the romaine hearts under cool running water. Wash the surface and between the leaves to remove any dirt and debris. 
            Shake well to remove moisture and dry using clean towels. Chop the lettuce into about ¾-inch pieces yielding about 8 cups.</li>
            
        <li>In a large bowl, add the lettuce. Top with cucumbers, tomatoes, green bell pepper, drained red onions, kalamata olives, and feta cheese.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together red wine vinegar, lemon zest, lemon juice, dijon mustard, 1 teaspoon honey (if using), minced garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Slowly drizzle the olive oil into the dressing mixture, continuously and vigorously whisking until you achieve a thickened dressing—season with salt and pepper to taste. 
            If not serving right away, whisk again right before adding to the salad as it may separate over time.</li>
        <li>Right before serving, drizzle half of the dressing over the salad, gently toss to coat. Serve the remaining on the side. Garnish with more vegetables and cheese as desired.
        </li>
    </ol>

<div class="name"><strong>Cob Salad</strong></div>
<div>Cobb salad is an American low-carb entree made with fresh produce, various proteins and tossed in a tangy red wine vinegar dressing.</div>
<br>
    <div>Ingredients:</div>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>4 cups ice cubes</li>
        <li>4 cups cold water</li>
        <li>4 strips bacon, thick cut, about 6 ounces</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon paprika, sweet or smoked</li>
        <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast, 2 pieces</li>
        <li>10 cups romaine lettuce, cut into 3/4-inch pieces, about 3 hearts</li>
        <li>1 cup baby tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>½ cup red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 large avocado, sliced or cubed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped chives</li>
        <li>2 ounces blue cheese, about ½ cup</li>
        <li>¼ cup red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dijon mustard</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced shallots</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <div>Instruction</div>
    <div>Hard Boiled Eggs</div>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with enough water to cover the eggs by 1-inch once added. Bring to a boil at 212°F (100°C), 
            then carefully place the eggs inside. Cook for 30 seconds, then place the lid on and reduce heat to low. 
            Cook on a low simmer for 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, add ice and cold water. Once the eggs are done, immediately transfer them to the ice bath 
            to chill for 15 minutes. Afterward, crack the sides of the eggshell, peel, and cut each in half lengthwise.</li>
        </ol>
        <div>Chicken</div>
        <ol>
        <li>Seasonings: In a small bowl, combine 1 teaspoon kosher salt, ½ teaspoon black pepper, and paprika.</li>
        <li>Prep: Cut each piece of chicken in half horizontally. This should create four ½-inch thick pieces. 
            Evenly season both sides of the chicken with the seasoning mix.
            Alternatively, place one of the chicken pieces between two plastic sheets or in a large plastic bag. 
            Flatten to an even thickness, about ½-inch thick. Repeat with the remaining piece.</li>
        <li>Cook: In the same pan used to fry the bacon, cook the chicken. Heat the pan over medium heat. 
            Once hot, add the chicken. Cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C), 
            about 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a clean plate to cool. Slice crosswise into strips, or cut into cubes.
            Alternatively, use a large clean skillet with 1 tablespoon of olive oil.</li></ol>
            <div>Lettuce</div>
    <ol>    
        <li>
            Chop the lettuce into about ¾-inch pieces yielding about 10 cups. Transfer to a salad spinner, rinse with cold water, and dry.</li>
        <li>Arrange tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil leaves, overlapping on a platter.</li></ol>
        <div>Salad Dressing</div>
        <ol>   
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the red wine vinegar, dijon mustard, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper.</li>
        <li>Slowly drizzle in the olive oil, continuously whisking until a thickened dressing is formed. 
            Add the minced shallots and whisk to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
    <div>
        Serve
        In serving bowls or on a large platter, evenly portion out the lettuce. Top with the sliced eggs, chicken, bacon, tomatoes, 
        red onion, avocado, chopped chives, and blue cheese. Cover and refrigerate if not eating immediately. Drizzle dressing on top or serve on the side.
